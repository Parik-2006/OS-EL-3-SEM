# ⚡ WDS Scheduling Engine (Weighted Dynamic Scoring)

> **A Next-Generation Non-Preemptive CPU Scheduler.**
> *Designed for High-Performance Computing, Cloud Clusters, and Autonomous Systems.*

## 📖 Project Objective
Modern computing environments (like 5G Edge Gateways and AI Training Clusters) suffer from inefficiencies when using standard CPU schedulers:
* **FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve):** causes the "Convoy Effect" (UI freezes behind background tasks).
* **SJF (Shortest Job First):** causes "Starvation" (Long tasks never run).

**The Solution:**
The **Weighted Dynamic Score (WDS)** algorithm. It utilizes a **Cooperative Multitasking Architecture** where tasks yield control at specific checkpoints. The scheduler calculates a dynamic score based on **Efficiency**, **Fairness**, and **Priority** to decide the next task.

## ⚙️ The WDS Formula
The engine calculates a score ($S$) for every waiting process in real-time:

$$S = (W_{wait} \times T_{waiting}) + (W_{burst} \times \frac{30}{T_{burst}}) + (W_{prio} \times P_{level})$$

* **$W_{wait}$ (Aging Factor):** Prevents starvation by boosting the score of waiting tasks.
* **$W_{burst}$ (Efficiency):** Favors short jobs to reduce system latency.
* **$W_{prio}$ (Urgency):** Allows critical operations (e.g., "Emergency Braking") to override standard logic.

## 🌍 Real-World Scenarios
This project simulates WDS performance in four specific industries:

| Industry | The Problem | The WDS Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 AI Clusters** | Long training epochs block checkpoint saves. | **Yield Points:** WDS pauses training to run quick saves. |
| **📡 5G Edge** | 4K video streams block health alert packets. | **Packet Yielding:** Emergency packets get priority override. |
| **🚗 Autonomous OS** | Map downloads block Lidar obstacle detection. | **Context Switch:** Lidar gets instant CPU access. |
| **☁️ Cloud Functions** | Cold starts delay user login requests. | **Aging Factor:** Login requests gain score while waiting. |
